These are the reponses from our administrator study as collected between the 15th and 29th October.

There were 5 surveys in total for administrators. 

We have 32 responses between the 5 surveys.

The documents here show the summary statistics and the invididual responses from administrators.

We have removed the individual responses for anyone who did not consent for their data to be stored in an archive.
